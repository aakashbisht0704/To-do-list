# To-do-list
Started as a to do list for 2nd sem project but ended up being much more. This is my first Git Repository
<br>
I started by making a simple to do list but later added features like:
<br>1. Adding Birthdays
<br>2. Notification of Birthdays
<br>3. Check for festivals
<br>4. Notification of festivals
<br>
<br> With the already present features of:
<br>1. Adding a task
<br>2. Viewing tasks
<br>3. Marking tasks as done
